    "# Working with Larger Datasets with a Scalable Solution!\n",
    "Consider the size of the datasets you have worked with at Uni. Probably a few hundred megabytes or a couple gigabytes. Whilst `pandas` and `Excel` do have their use cases, it is not feasible to use them when you work with larger datasets over several gigabytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "1. 20k rows would be hard for Excel, but easy for `pandas`.\n",
    "2. A few million records would be doable for `pandas` depending on RAM (let's say 16GB or 32GB to be generous).\n",
    "3. Now, consider 100 million rows over several gigabytes. `pandas` **is not your solution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas` works in-memory. That is, you are limited by RAM which can be hard to come across for the average person. Even with 32GB or 64GB memory, it is best to use Apache Spark, which is designed to work with large datasets.\n",
