    "# Working with Larger Datasets with a Scalable Solution!\n",
    "Consider the size of the datasets you have worked with at Uni. Probably a few hundred megabytes or a couple gigabytes. Whilst `pandas` and `Excel` do have their use cases, it is not feasible to use them when you work with larger datasets over several gigabytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "1. 20k rows would be hard for Excel, but easy for `pandas`.\n",
    "2. A few million records would be doable for `pandas` depending on RAM (let's say 16GB or 32GB to be generous).\n",
    "3. Now, consider 100 million rows over several gigabytes. `pandas` **is not your solution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas` works in-memory. That is, you are limited by RAM which can be hard to come across for the average person. Even with 32GB or 64GB memory, it is best to use Apache Spark, which is designed to work with large datasets.\n",

    "- Windows 10 or 11 users are required to install `WSL` or `WSL2` for `pyspark`. This is something that you should take the time to learn how to use and install now for a future career in the tech industry. If you have yet to install it, please visit https://github.com/akiratwang/COMP20003\n",
    "- MacOS (Intel) or Linux is all good. If you are using an M1 or M2 chip, you will need to follow some specific instructions.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you really don't want to use spark, you can use `pandas` as usual. Just be aware of memory limitations and missed opportunity for upskilling yourself for a job! For those who don't want to use Spark, please run `pip3 install pandas fastparquet` and you can just read it in like this."

    "CSV:\n",
    "- `csv` are tabular data formats read in line by line using a `,` delimiter.\n",
    "- That is, these are stored by rows.\n",
    "- They consume a lot of disk space and are one of the **most inefficient** ways of storing data.\n",
    "- However, they are widely used and easy to use for smaller datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parquet:\n",
    "- `parquet` on the other hand is stored in columns and (ELI5) are very efficient with data formats.\n",
    "- For example, a single row in a `csv` can contain several different data types. \n",
    "- `parquet` just have the single data type per column, allowing compression algorithms to be applied to reduce disk space and read efficiency.\n",
    "- For alternatives to `csv` for row based data formats, you can take a look at `avro`.\n",

    "### An Incorrect Example\n",
    "- Scenario: Student does analysis on `tip_amount` and finds several `NULL` values and either drops them or includes it in the analysis. Later on, they use a regression model to predict this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Result: According to the data dictionary, `tip_amount` is automatically populated for credit card tips (`payment_type` is `1`). Cash tips are not included. This means that the students' analysis included all payment types despite this field clearly specifying the rule. \n",

    "- Penalty: The student will lose marks on the analysis section. The modelling section will be marked _assuming_ they got this filtering method correct. However, if another issue pops up due to this, there will be another penalty applied. Please get this right!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Solution: Student should filter for only `payment_type=1` and now, the student can (hopefully) conduct correct analysis on `tip_amount`.\n",
